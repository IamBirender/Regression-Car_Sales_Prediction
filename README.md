# Regression-Car_Sales_Prediction

One of the major automobile company would like to design new product which gives high sales. In order to define the product, they want to understand and identify important drivers for the sales (what are the factors driving sales) and Predict the new car sales for given car model with defined factors.

### Expectations

1. Understand the data and perform the data preparation before the model building.
2. Perform all the modeling steps including pre and post modeling steps like data preparation and implementation of the model.
3. Understand output and explain the model fit.
4. Determine what is the "best" linear model?
5. Apply transformation to the given variables and find out the possible best model after transformations.
6. Generate the final equation.
7. Validate the model and present the results in Excel or PPT.
